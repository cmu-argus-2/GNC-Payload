# GNC-Payload
This repo strives to house everything associated with the payload of the Argus satellite. This includes:
- Scripts for downloading Landsat and Sentinel data (image_downloader folder)
- Scripts for training and running inference of the region classifier and landmark detector (vision_inference folder)
- Orbit determination algorithms (orbit_determination folder)
- Code for mocking IMU measurements (sensors folder)
- Code for simulating images given a position and orientation of the satellite in ECEF (image_simulation folder)

Code from the following repos was used as a starting point:
- [Earth Engine Downloader](https://github.com/cmuabstract/eedl)
- [Vision Pipeline Inference](https://github.com/cmu-argus-1/FSW-Jetson/tree/main/flight/vision)
- [Image Simulation](https://github.com/kyledmccleary/earth-vis-argus)
- [Vision Training Pipelines](https://github.com/cmu-argus-1/VisionTrainingGround)
